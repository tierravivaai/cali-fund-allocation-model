# Banded TSAC: Implementation Specification

## Note

This is an experimental approach with applying banding logic to the FAOSTAT land area data. It has not been fully implemented and exists on the terrestrial branch
and has been parked for the moment.

## Purpose

Replace the linear land-area weighting in TSAC with a log₁₀-banded scheme that mirrors the existing IUSAF banding methodology. This addresses v4 finding 3.6 (Band 6 / China dominance) by making the TSAC weight structure consistent with the rest of the model.

## Background

Current TSAC weight for Party *i*:

> w_i = A_i / Σ A_j

where `A_i` is the terrestrial land area of Party *i* in km².

This produces excessive concentration at the top: under linear weighting, China holds roughly 12% of the TSAC pool and the top-10 Parties together hold roughly 46%. As a consequence, the TSAC component first exceeds the IUSAF component for China at β ≥ 2%, and reaches a maximum ratio of 10.6× at the grid corner.

The proposed change replaces direct land-area weighting with a banded scheme, where Parties are assigned to one of six bands by order of magnitude of land area, and each band has a flat per-Party weight. This mirrors the existing IUSAF six-band log₁₀ structure.

## Specification

### Step 1: Band assignment

For each eligible Party with terrestrial land area `A_i` (km²), assign band `b_i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}` as follows:

| Band | Range (km²) | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | A < 10³ | Very small |
| 2 | 10³ ≤ A < 10⁴ | Small |
| 3 | 10⁴ ≤ A < 10⁵ | Medium-small |
| 4 | 10⁵ ≤ A < 10⁶ | Medium |
| 5 | 10⁶ ≤ A < 10⁷ | Large |
| 6 | A ≥ 10⁷ | Very large |

Band numbering follows the existing IUSAF convention: higher band number = higher magnitude.

Boundary convention: lower bound inclusive (≥), upper bound exclusive (<).

### Step 2: Per-band weight assignment

Each band `b` is assigned a positive weight `W_b`. These are policy parameters and must be configurable at runtime. The default proposal is a geometric progression with base 2:

> W_1 = 1, W_2 = 2, W_3 = 4, W_4 = 8, W_5 = 16, W_6 = 32

The default is illustrative; the band weights are intended to be calibrated against the v4 grid metrics (see Test Plan §4) and are expected to be set during the methodological review process.

Constraints on `W_b`:

- `W_b > 0` for all b
- `W_{b+1} ≥ W_b` (monotonicity — higher bands have ≥ weight than lower bands)

### Step 3: Per-Party unnormalised weight

For each Party *i* with band `b_i`:

> u_i = W_{b_i}

### Step 4: Normalisation

Normalise across all eligible Parties:

> w_i = u_i / Σ_j u_j

The resulting `w_i` is the Party's TSAC weight, replacing the current land-area-derived value. Downstream use of `w_i` (in the final share blend) is unchanged.

## Reference implementation (Python)

```python
import numpy as np
from typing import Sequence

# Default band lower bounds in km² (inclusive)
DEFAULT_BAND_LOWER_BOUNDS = (0.0, 1e3, 1e4, 1e5, 1e6, 1e7)

# Default per-band weights (geometric, base=2)
DEFAULT_BAND_WEIGHTS = (1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 16.0, 32.0)


def assign_band(land_area_km2: float,
                lower_bounds: Sequence[float] = DEFAULT_BAND_LOWER_BOUNDS) -> int:
    """Return band index (1..N) for a Party's land area."""
    if land_area_km2 < 0:
        raise ValueError(f"Land area must be non-negative, got {land_area_km2}")
    band = 1
    for i, lb in enumerate(lower_bounds):
        if land_area_km2 >= lb:
            band = i + 1
    return band


def banded_tsac_weights(land_areas: np.ndarray,
                        band_weights: Sequence[float] = DEFAULT_BAND_WEIGHTS,
                        lower_bounds: Sequence[float] = DEFAULT_BAND_LOWER_BOUNDS
                        ) -> np.ndarray:
    """Compute normalised TSAC weights using log-banded land area.

    if len(band_weights) != len(lower_bounds):
        raise ValueError("band_weights and lower_bounds must be the same length")
    if any(w <= 0 for w in band_weights):
        raise ValueError("All band weights must be strictly positive")
    if any(band_weights[i + 1] < band_weights[i] for i in range(len(band_weights) - 1)):
        raise ValueError("Band weights must be non-decreasing")

    bands = np.array([assign_band(a, lower_bounds) for a in land_areas])
    weights = np.array([band_weights[b - 1] for b in bands], dtype=float)
    total = weights.sum()
    if total == 0:
        raise ValueError("Sum of weights is zero — check inputs")
    return weights / total
```

## Integration

The current TSAC weight computation lives in `src/cali_model/sensitivity_scenarios.py` (and possibly `src/cali_model/calculator.py`). Locate the existing function that produces the TSAC weight vector — currently a normalised land-area vector — and replace its body with a call to `banded_tsac_weights`.

The calling signature must remain unchanged: input is a vector of land areas, output is a vector of normalised weights summing to 1.0. Downstream code (the final-share blend, grid generation, integrity checks) requires no changes.

## Validation invariants

The implementation must satisfy all of the following. These should be added to the existing integrity-check framework in `src/cali_model/sensitivity_metrics.py`.

1. **Sum to one**: `|Σ w_i − 1.0| < 1e-12`
2. **Non-negativity**: `w_i ≥ 0` for all *i*
3. **Band monotonicity**: for any two Parties *i*, *j* with `b_i > b_j`, `w_i ≥ w_j`
4. **Scale invariance**: weights are independent of the unit of land area — calling the function with land areas in km² and m² produces identical normalised weights
5. **Determinism**: identical inputs produce bit-identical outputs across runs

## Test plan

1. **Uniform-weights sanity**: with all `W_b` set to 1.0, the function returns `1/N` for each of *N* Parties.
2. **One-Party-per-band**: synthetic input with exactly one Party in each band and default weights — verify each output equals `W_b / Σ W_b`.
3. **Boundary cases**: a Party with `A = 1e6` exactly is assigned to band 5 (lower bound inclusive). A Party with `A = 999,999` is in band 4.
4. **Reproduction of v4 grid**: re-run the v4 sensitivity scenarios with banded TSAC weights replacing the linear ones. Regenerate `tsac_sosac_grid_coarse.csv`, `tsac_sosac_grid_fine.csv`, and the four heatmaps. Compare against the current v4 outputs along four headline metrics:
    - Location of gini-minimum on the two-way surface
    - β at which TSAC/IUSAF ratio first crosses 1.0 for any Party (currently 2%)
    - Maximum TSAC/IUSAF ratio across the grid (currently 10.6×)
    - Number of scenarios in the moderate-overlay zone (currently 35/176)
5. **Integrity checks**: re-run all nine integrity check categories on the sampled scenarios. All must continue to pass.

## Outputs to regenerate

The following v4 artefacts depend on the TSAC weight definition and must be regenerated after the change:

- `tsac_sosac_grid_coarse.csv`
- `tsac_sosac_grid_fine.csv`
- `tsac_sosac_heatmap_gini_coarse.png`
- `tsac_sosac_heatmap_gini_fine.png`
- `tsac_sosac_heatmap_spearman_coarse.png`
- `tsac_sosac_heatmap_spearman_fine.png`
- `integrity_checks.csv`
- `scale_invariance.csv`
- `country_results.csv`

The IUSAF-side artefacts (`fig_e1_un_scale_raw_inversion_data.csv`, `fig_e1_generate.py`) are unaffected — banding applies to TSAC only.

## Configuration

Expose the following parameters in the scenario configuration alongside existing β and γ:

- `tsac_band_lower_bounds`: tuple of 6 floats (defaults as above)
- `tsac_band_weights`: tuple of 6 floats (defaults as above)

This permits what-if analysis: changing the geometric base, adjusting individual band weights, or collapsing bands by setting adjacent weights equal.

## Calibration harness

The per-band weights `W_1 … W_6` are policy parameters, not technical defaults, and must be set by the methodological review group after inspecting the distributional consequences. The implementer does **not** select these values. Instead, the implementer builds a calibration harness that allows a human to sweep candidate configurations and compare them against the v4 grid metrics.

### Harness specification

Build a script `scripts/calibrate_banded_tsac.py` that:

1. Accepts as input a set of candidate band-weight configurations. Two formats must be supported:
    - A named preset (e.g. `geometric_base_2`, `geometric_base_1.5`, `linear_progression`, `flat`, `capped_top`)
    - An explicit tuple `(W_1, W_2, W_3, W_4, W_5, W_6)` passed via CLI or config file
2. For each configuration, re-runs the coarse two-way grid (176 scenarios) with banded TSAC weights computed from that configuration.
3. For each configuration, computes and reports the following headline metrics:
    - Gini-minimum location on the two-way surface (β, γ, Gini value)
    - β at which the TSAC/IUSAF ratio first crosses 1.0 for any Party
    - Maximum TSAC/IUSAF ratio across the grid and the binding Party at that point
    - Number of scenarios in the moderate-overlay zone (ρ ≥ 0.85)
    - SIDS total ($m) and LDC total ($m) at the gini-minimum point
    - Top-10 Parties by TSAC share, with shares
4. Outputs a comparison table (`calibration_results.csv`) with one row per configuration, and produces side-by-side headline-metric plots (`calibration_comparison.png`).
5. Runs all nine integrity checks on a sample from each configuration's grid and reports pass/fail.

### Suggested preset configurations

The harness should ship with at least the following presets for the group to compare:

| Preset name | (W_1, W_2, W_3, W_4, W_5, W_6) | Rationale |
|-------------|----------------------------------|-----------|
| `flat` | (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) | Equal per-Party weight; floor benchmark |
| `geometric_base_1.5` | (1, 1.5, 2.25, 3.4, 5.1, 7.6) | Gentle progression |
| `geometric_base_2` | (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32) | Moderate progression |
| `geometric_base_3` | (1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243) | Steep progression (approaches linear) |
| `capped_top` | (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 16) | Geometric but top band capped at Band 5 weight |
| `linear_progression` | (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) | Linear in band index |

The harness must make it trivial to add further presets — a simple dictionary entry — so the group can iterate during review.

### Acceptance criteria for calibration

The group should select the band-weight configuration using the following criteria, in order of priority:

1. **Primary**: TSAC/IUSAF ratio remains ≤ 2.0 across the entire two-way grid. This is the direct response to v4 finding 3.6.
2. **Secondary**: The moderate-overlay zone (ρ ≥ 0.85) contains at least as many scenarios as under the current (linear) TSAC specification.
3. **Tertiary**: Gini-minimum on the two-way surface is at least as low as under the current specification (i.e. the change does not worsen the best achievable distributional outcome).
4. **Subjective**: Distribution of TSAC shares among top-10 Parties is judged reasonable by the review group — not a purely technical criterion.

A configuration satisfying criteria 1–3 and judged acceptable under criterion 4 is a candidate for adoption. If no preset satisfies all criteria, the harness supports arbitrary explicit tuples so the group can iterate toward one that does.

### Deliverables from calibration

The implementer delivers:

- The calibration harness script and its outputs for the six presets above
- A brief written summary (1 page) noting which presets satisfy criteria 1–3 and flagging any that dominate others across all metrics
- A recommendation is **not** required and should not be made; the selection is a group decision

The group then selects a configuration, which is recorded in the v4.1 methodology documentation and used as the default `tsac_band_weights` going forward.

## Out of scope

This specification covers replacing the linear land-area weighting with a banded scheme only. The following are explicit non-goals:

- Replacing land area with a multi-indicator stewardship index (deferred to v5+ workstream)
- Changing IUSAF or SOSAC weight computation
- Changing the final-share blend formula `(1 − β − γ) · IUSAF + β · TSAC + γ · SOSAC`
- Changing the floor/ceiling mechanism

## Documentation updates required

The following documents must be updated to reflect the new TSAC computation once implementation is complete:

- `technical_annex.md` — formula specification section
- `executive_summary.md` — methodology paragraph and findings list
- Any methodology section in the v4 reports that describes TSAC weights as proportional to land area
