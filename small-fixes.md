# Small Fixes and Follow-Ups

## Resolved (v4.0+)

2. ~~**Ground the Spearman threshold**~~ — **Resolved in v4.0.** Option D (band-order preservation + Spearman safety floor 0.80) was adopted. The arbitrary 0.85 threshold is replaced. See `optiond-threshold-revision-rationale.md`.

3. ~~**Make `_spearman_by_party()` self-filtering**~~ — **Resolved in v4.0.** `_eligible()` filter is now used throughout `sensitivity_metrics.py`. All callers of `_spearman_by_party` pass through filtered data.

4. ~~**Rename "Gini-optimal" → "Gini-minimum" in code and UI**~~ — **Resolved in v4.0.** All code, scenarios, and UI labels now use `gini_minimum`. No `gini_optimal` occurrences remain in `src/`.

7. ~~**Resolve `use_container_width` deprecation in Streamlit app**~~ — **Moot.** The app uses `st.plotly_chart(use_container_width=True)` which is not deprecated. No `st.pyplot` usage exists.

## Priority: High

1. **Generate isolated-TSAC sweep (SOSAC = 0%)** — A dedicated sweep with SOSAC = 0% is needed to verify provisional threshold values in setup (a) of the component rationale. Current values (order overturn ~2.95%, component overturn ~9.2%) are from ad hoc runs and require confirmation. See `docs/component-rationale.md` "Sensitivity Analysis Setups" and `docs/spearman-threshold-assessment.md`.

## Priority: Medium

5. **Reconcile TSAC overturn scenario metadata** — The `tsac_overturn.csv` was regenerated with SOSAC = 3%, giving TSAC = 1.80% (China component overturn). The rationale previously cited TSAC ~9.2% from an isolated-TSAC analysis. The scenario description in `band-analysis/break-points/readme.md` should be updated to reflect the current setup.

## Priority: Low

6. ~~**Add land area for 4 high-income parties**~~ — **Resolved via name mapping.** Added `"Republic of Korea": "Korea, Rep."`, `"Slovakia": "Slovak Republic"`, `"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland": "United Kingdom"`, and `"Netherlands (Kingdom of the)": "Netherlands"` to `LAND_AREA_NAME_MAP` so the World Bank CSV JOIN resolves correctly. No hard-coded patches needed; data flows from the authoritative source.

8. ~~**Fix relative path in `load_band_config()`**~~ — **Resolved.** Changed from `os.path.join("config", ...)` (CWD-dependent) to `Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent.parent / "config" / "un_scale_bands.yaml"` (robust, `__file__`-relative).
