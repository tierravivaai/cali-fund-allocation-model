# Cali Fund Allocation Model (Inverted UN Scale Option)

An interactive policy-support tool for biodiversity fund allocation under the CBD Cali Fund. The model uses the inverted UN Scale of Assessments (IUSAF) with optional terrestrial and ocean biodiversity stewardship overlays to compute indicative allocations for CBD Parties.

The objective is to create a simple, easy to communicate formula. That formula can be easily expressed in plain Englih as follows:

> The Cali Fund Allocation formula is based on an inverted United Nations Scale of Assessments used to determine member states contributions to the UN budget. It includes components recognising the different ocean and terrestrial biodiversity stewardship responsibilities among Parties. Recognition of the vital role of indigenous peoples and local communities is integral to the formula.

As a simple formula this can be expressed as follows

Country Share = Inverted UN Scale + Ocean Stewardship + Terrestrial Stewardship

As overlays the Ocean and Terrestrial Stewardship Components reallocate funds from the equity base of the Inverted UN Scale to the Ocean or Terrestrial Stewardship Components. If the Inverted UN Scale is accepted as the baseline then the key question becomes what values in percentage terms should be assigned to the Ocean (SOSAC) and Terrestrial (TSAC) components. 

This approach treats indigenous peoples and local communities as integral to the formula. This is achieved by dividing the country allocation equally between the state and indigenous peoples and local communities. Indigenous peoples and local communities in developed countries are addressed separately as part of a technical paper exercise. This is not currently included in the application itself.

The formula and its model are grounded in paragraphs 17 and 18 of the Annex to decision 16/2. The prop



## The Formula

The approach to the allocation formula deliberately avoids the use of mathematical notation in favour of ease of communication. However, the formula can be formally expressed as:  

**Final Share = (1 − β − γ) × IUSAF + β × TSAC + γ × SOSAC**

- **IUSAF**: Inverted UN Scale — the equity base, tilted towards lower-income and LDC countries.
- **TSAC**: Terrestrial Stewardship — proportional to land area (km²).
- **SOSAC**: SIDS Ocean Stewardship — equal-share pool for eligible Small Island Developing States
.
- **β, γ**: User-adjustable overlay weights. **The central policy question is where to set the balance between the equity base and the stewardship overlays.**

## Application Layers

### `app.py` — Main Negotiation App

The primary interactive interface for exploring policy scenarios.

**Features:**
- Adjustable fund size ($2m–$10bn), IPLC split (50–80%), TSAC (0–15%), SOSAC (0–10%)
- Five negotiation presets: Equality, Inverted UN Scale, Terrestrial Stewardship, Oceans Stewardship, Gini-minimum point
- Band-based inversion (default) or raw inversion mode
- High-income country exclusion (off by default for equality start)
- Optional floor and ceiling constraints
- **Negotiation Dashboard**: increases/decreases vs baseline, group impact charts, per-country waterfall, stewardship scenario comparison
- Multi-perspective tabs: By Party, By Region, By Income Group, LDC, SIDS, Inversion Comparison
- Plain-language and technical explanation toggles
- Blend warnings when stewardship weights become strong or overriding

### `sensitivity.py` — Sensitivity & Robustness App

Dedicated parameter-sweep and reporting interface for reviewers and statisticians.

**Features:**
- Coarse (TSAC×SOSAC, 11×16 = 176 scenarios) and fine (21×21 = 441 scenarios) grids
- Per-scenario Gini coefficient, Spearman ρ vs pure IUSAF, band-order preservation, TSAC/IUSAF ratios
- Balance-point identification (Gini-minimum subject to structural constraints)
- Integrity checks export (`integrity_checks.csv`)
- Markdown summary generation
- Named balance-point scenarios: `gini_minimum`, `band_order_overturn`, `stewardship_forward`

### `banded_app.py` — Experimental Banded TSAC Variant

**Available on the `terrestrial` branch only.** A parallel app using `tsac_mode="banded"` (log₁₀ land-area bands with geometric_base_2 weights) instead of linear land area. Extended sliders (0–30%), three balance-point presets (Strict, Gini-minimum, Boundary), and a Spearman-based overlay warning. See [banded_app_spec_v3.md](../banded_app_spec_v3.md) for details.

## Balance Points (v4.0)

The v4.0 methodology replaces the arbitrary Spearman ρ ≥ 0.85 threshold with **band-order preservation** (Band 5 mean > Band 6 mean) plus a Spearman safety floor of 0.80. Key reference points at SOSAC=3%:

| Point | TSAC | Gini | Spearman ρ | Definition |
|-------|------|------|-----------|-----------|
| Gini-minimum | 2.5% | 0.0886 | 0.945 | Lowest Gini preserving band order |
| Band-order overturn | 3.0% | — | 0.93 | Band 6 overtakes Band 5 |
| Stewardship-forward | 5.0% | — | — | Exploratory reference |

## IPLC Developed-Country Analysis

The `iplc-developed/` directory contains a paper-exercise calculating IPLC allocations for 9 developed countries (Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Sweden) under two hypothetical scenarios:

- **Option 1**: Raw equality for all Parties, filtered to the 9 countries (IPLC ≈ 2.30% of fund).
- **Option 2**: Banded IUSAF with the 9 countries added to Bands 4–5 (IPLC ≈ 2.11% of fund).

The closeness of these results is structurally expected: Band 4 countries gain relative to equality while Band 5 countries lose, and the effects partially cancel. See [iplc-developed/validation_analysis.md](iplc-developed/validation_analysis.md).

Four structural integration options (A–D) are analysed in [iplc-developed/iplc-integration-options.md](iplc-developed/iplc-integration-options.md). Option D (unified pool with State-component return) is recommended.

## Version History

See [change_log.md](change_log.md) for the full versioned history. Key milestones:

- **v3**: 6-band IUSAF, Gini reporting, balance-point analysis, 138 tests
- **v4.0**: Band-order preservation replaces Spearman 0.85 threshold, gini_optimal → gini_minimum rename
- **v4.1**: Balance-point ranking tables, IPLC developed-country tables, DuckDB fix
- **v4.2**: Banded TSAC app, calibration harness, v4 sensitivity reports (terrestrial branch)
- **v4.2.1**: DuckDB StringDtype fix on main, IPLC structural validation (40 tests)

## Use of AI

The code base is written in Python using Factory AI Droid as the development harness. Current main coding model: GLM-5 (Z.ai). High-level reasoning through Opus 4.6–4.7 and GPT-5.4 Codex. Code planning and automated peer review uses GPT-5 Codex, Claude Opus 4.6, and Gemini Pro. Independent review sessions with clean context are preferred. The responsible human is Dr. Paul Oldham.
